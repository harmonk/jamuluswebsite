Newbie here, sorry if this is badly done.
Jamulus crashes on my Macbook Pro, every time. Opens for a few seconds, blinks out. 3 or 4 days ago, used it without a problem.
Have updated to 15.2 but used it after then fine.
Reinstalled Jamulus several times, also with older versions. Deleted all possible related files before reinstalling. Restarted computer of course.
